About Dataset


Description:
Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Dataset, a valuable resource for researchers, data scientists, and medical professionals interested in the field of diabetes risk assessment and prediction. This dataset contains a diverse range of health-related attributes, meticulously collected to aid in the development of predictive models for identifying individuals at risk of diabetes. By sharing this dataset, we aim to foster collaboration and innovation within the data science community, leading to improved early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies for diabetes.


Columns:
Id: Unique identifier for each data entry.
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg / height in m^2).
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function, a genetic score of diabetes.
Age: Age in years.
Outcome: Binary classification indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.
